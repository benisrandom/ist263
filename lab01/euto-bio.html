        Hello, my name is Ben Euto and I am a sophomore with a major in Information Management and Technology. I am interested in working with computers on the analysis side of things. So far, with my major, I have developed some experience with Python, and I have also developed good presenting skills. I am also good with memorization, time management and creative thinking. Outside of class, I tend to be a chill person. My hobbies include video editing and reading, although I spend more time editing. I am unsure whether or not to pursue something like that as a minor. I have lived in upstate New York all my life. I have an older sister who is a senior majoring in Marketing, and I am apart of a family of 4. I have a dog named Buddy who is 13 years old.
        I hope you have enjoyed the opportunity to learn a little more about me. Thank you for visiting my webpage, and I hope you have a good day :)
