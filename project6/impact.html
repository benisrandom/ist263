    <h2>THE IMPACT OF AI IMAGES</h2>
    <section>
        <p>So now that we've gotten to know the wonderful world of AI-generated images better, one can't help 
        but ask: how will this affect our future?<p>
        <p>For one, as stated in the home page, AI-generated images add on to the wacky world of artificial 
        intelligence as a whole, and as such are leaving as much of an impact as AI is continuing to leave on our 
        everyday lives. This is especially true for programs like DALL-E 2, which can not only generate images 
        with a much more enhanced sense of photorealism, but can also apply filters to and edit specific parts of 
        existing images in the same way that photo editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, edit existing 
        images. However, the ability of these programs to create new images automatically can potentially clash 
        with the manual work of experienced artists. In fact, it could become harder to distinguish what is 
        manually drawn and what is automatically generated.</p>

        <img src="../project/images/20190422150710-GettyImages-175822209.jpg" width="200" alt="Stock art of a robotic arm taking a human man out of a line of people" class="arm">
        <p class="left">In fact, this is one of the major concerns of AI-generated images: what's real and what's fake? And how 
        will they affect experienced artists who do manual work?</p>
        <p class="left">Programs like DALL-E 2 have such an elevated sense of photorealism that it can fool even the keenest of 
        observers into believing that an image is actually a real photograph when in reality it's actually AI-generated. And while that is extremely impressive, it's also pretty alarming. 
        <p class="left">Given that AI programs like these have the tendency to have their popularity spread like wildfire, there's no doubt that photorealistic AI-generated images will become a popular trend. Once that happens, it becomes enough of a cultural norm in our society, how will we be able to tell what's real and what's not?</p>

        <p class="right">While these programs are impressive, they could also consequently damage our sense of reality. Now, 
        that's not to say that they'll lead people to believe that an astronaut can truly wear jorts and fly on a 
        soda can. But given that these programs are able to do things that Photoshop can do, will there really be 
        a need for these types of programs? 
        <p>These are the types of concerns that experienced manual artists will have to face moving forward. Hopefully, however, a happy medium will arise, and people will be able to enjoy the wacky world of AI-generated images without stealing the spotlight from these talented artists.</p>
