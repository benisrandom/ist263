                <p class="programtext">So now that we know what AI generated images are and how these programs function, we're left with another question: how many of these programs are there?</p>
                <p class="programtext">Well, that's what we're going to find out here. There's a handful of various programs that can be accessed across multiple platforms.</p>

                        <h3>DALL-E</h3>
                        <p>The most popular program for AI generated images is DALL-E. DALL-E is a software created by a 
                        company called OpenAI. It was released on January 5, 2021, and is currently not an open-access 
                        software. In order to access it, you'll have to go on their official website, fill out an online form, and ideally at some point in the future they'll send you an email notifying you that you've been granted 
                        access to it. From there, you can use it and play with it to your will.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="midjourney">
                        <h3>Midjourney</h3>
                        <p>There also exists another software, Midjourney, that takes a couple forms. It can be used as an 
                        individual software or as a Discord bot with limited features. Midjourney, however, costs money. 
                        Specifically, users will have to pay $30 a month for a standard membership with unlimited usage or pay 
                        $10 a month to generate only 200 images per month, and this is all once the program comes out of 
                        beta. You can sign up for the beta version for free, however you'll only get 25 free images that you'll be able to generate.</p>

            <h3>Other Programs</h3>
                <p class="programtext">A smaller, more publicly accessible version of DALL-E is also available. This version, titled DALL-E Mini, is open source and free to the public. All you have to do is go on their website and from there you can use the program to your will. What differentiates DALL-E Mini from DALL-E is that they are not made by the same people. Instead, DALL-E Mini is made by an individual with public datasets. DALL-E Mini is also not as filtered as DALL-E, so literally any prompt will be accepted, as opposed to DALL-E's various safety 
                protocols that limit what prompts you can type in.</p>
                <p class="programtext">OpenAI has also developed a newer version of DALL-E, titled DALL-E 2. This version of DALL-E is also invite-only. DALL-E 2 is technically free this way, however it also implements a credit-based fee 
                structure, so first-time users will only get a finite amount of credits to generate whatever images they 
                want, however once they run out, users will have to purchase more. The benefit that comes with DALL-E 
                2, however, is that it has much more advanced code that allows for more photorealism and can also 
                create alterations of existing images by applying filters or adding/removing individual aspects of them.</p>
