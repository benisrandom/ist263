    <h2>THE IMPACT OF AI IMAGES</h2>
    <main>
        <article id="content">
            <div class="fadeinfirst">
                <h3><strong>WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE?</strong></h3>
                <p class="impactcenter">So now that we've gotten to know the wonderful world of AI-generated images better, one can't help but ask: how will this affect our future?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fadeinsecond">
                <p class="impactcenter">For one, as stated in the home page, AI-generated images add on to the wacky world of artificial 
                intelligence as a whole, and as such are leaving as much of an impact as AI is continuing to leave on our 
                everyday lives. This is especially true for programs like DALL-E 2, which can not only generate images 
                with a much more enhanced sense of photorealism, but can also apply filters to and edit specific parts of 
                existing images in the same way that photo editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, edit existing 
                images. However, the ability of these programs to create new images automatically can potentially clash 
                with the manual work of experienced artists. In fact, it could become harder to distinguish what is 
                manually drawn and what is automatically generated.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="fadeinfourth">
                <div class="arm">
                    <div class="armimage">
                        <img class="impactsize" src="../project/images/20190422150710-GettyImages-175822209_resized.jpg" alt="Stock art of a robotic arm taking a human man out of a line of people">
                    </div>
                    <div class="armtext">
                        <p>In fact, this is one of the major concerns of AI-generated images: what's real and what's fake? And how will they affect experienced artists who do manual work?</p> <br>
                        <p>Programs like DALL-E 2 have such an elevated sense of photorealism that it can fool even the keenest of observers into believing that an image is actually a real photograph when in reality it's actually AI-generated. And while that is extremely impressive, it's also pretty alarming.</p> <br>
                        <p>Given that AI programs like these have the tendency to have their popularity spread like wildfire, there's no doubt that photorealistic AI-generated images will become a popular trend. Once that happens, it becomes enough of a cultural norm in our society, how will we be able to tell what's real and what's not?</p>

                <div class="city">
                    <div class="cityimage">
                        <img class="impactsize" src="../project/images/3sulj0_resized.jpg" alt="Stock image of a robotic, futuristic city">
                    </div>
                    <div class="citytext">
                        <p>While these programs are impressive, they could also consequently damage our sense of reality. Now, 
                         that's not to say that they'll lead people to believe that an astronaut can truly wear jorts and fly on a soda can. But given that these programs are able to do things that Photoshop can do, will there really be a need for these types of programs?</p> <br>
                        <p>These are the types of concerns that experienced manual artists will have to face moving forward. Hopefully, however, a happy medium will arise, and people will be able to enjoy the wacky world of AI-generated images without stealing the spotlight from these talented artists.</p>
