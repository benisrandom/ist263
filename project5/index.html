        <h2>WHAT IS AI IMAGERY?</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence has been on the rise for decades, and now it's gotten to the point where it rapidly 
        grows and becomes more advanced by the day. AI can do lots of everyday tasks and is learning more of 
        them at an exponential rate, making our lives just a little bit easier each day. The barrier between reality 
        and imagination is diminishing ever so quickly, and probably the most prime example of this statement 
        is the world of AI-generated images.</p>
        <p>So we have to ask: what are they, exactly?</p>
        <p>Well, in short, you are met with a program. This program asks you to do one thing and one thing only -
        type in a prompt. Any prompt. Let your imagination run wild. Think of the wildest, strangest, most 
        specific prompt you can think of. For example, let's say I want to see something along the lines of
        “astronaut wearing jorts soaring through space on a soda can”.</p>
        <img src="../project/images/dalleshot.PNG" width="800" alt="First screenshot of DALL-E before I type in anything">
        <p>I'll then press enter and the program will take a few minutes to work its magic. After a few minutes 
        passed, this was the result I got.</p>
        <img src="../project/images/dalleshot2.PNG" width="800" alt="Second DALL-E screenshot after I typed in my prompt">
        <p>And now we have several iterations of our jort-wearing astronaut on his soda can. As you can see, the 
        images are not crystal clear. They look painted and some features are more defined than others, yet 
        they're clear enough that you're able to tell that they are, indeed, depicting an astronaut wearing jorts soaring through space on a soda can.</p>
