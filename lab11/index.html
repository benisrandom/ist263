            <h1>Ben Euto's Biography</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello, my name is <strong>Ben Euto</strong> and I am a sophomore with a major in <strong>Information Management and Technology</strong>. I am interested in working with computers on the analysis side of things. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So far, with my major, I have developed some experience with Python, and I have also developed good presenting skills. I am also good with memorization, time management and creative thinking. 
                </p>
                
                <h2>Personal Information</h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of class, I tend to be a chill person. My hobbies include video editing and reading, although I spend more time editing. I am unsure whether or not to pursue something like that as a minor. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have lived in upstate New York all my life. I have an older sister who is a senior majoring in Marketing, and I am apart of a family of 4. I have a dog named Buddy who is 13 years old.
                </p>
